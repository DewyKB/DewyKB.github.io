# Blog post guidelines

* Posts should include an `image` in the frontmatter. 
  The image can't be an SVG, and should be 1200x627 (for LinkedIn, others may vary).
* LinkedIn prefers a "description" that's at least 100 characters long.
* Keywords can help with SEO - ChatGPT can generate these for you quickly.
